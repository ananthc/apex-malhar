/***
 * <p>Used to specify if a given API invocation in the in-memory interpreter is going to be invoked for all the worker
 *  threads, a sticky thread or just any one thread.
 *
 *  - {@link WorkerExecutionMode#ALL_WORKERS} is to be used when the
 *   command is resulting in a state of the interpreter which has to be used in subsequent calls. For example,
 *   deserializing a machine learning model can be used as a ALL_WORKERS model as the scoring can then be invoked across
 *   all worker threads if required.
 *  - {@link WorkerExecutionMode#ANY_WORKER} Represents a state wherein any worker can be used to execute the code.
 *   Example would be scoring an incoming tuple on which the model has already been deserialized across all nodes
 *  - {@link WorkerExecutionMode#STICKY_WORKER} Use STICKY_WORKER if the same worker needs to service the request.
 *    The downside of this is that it may or may not complete on time and depends on the queue length.</p>
 *
 *   <p><b>Ensure the {@link PythonInterpreterRequest#hashCode()} is overridden if STICKY_WORKER is chosen </b></p>
